# Smart Public Transport Reservation System (RFID Card Reader Module)

This **RFID Card Reader Module** is designed as part of the smart public transport reservation system to facilitate a smooth, secure, and efficient boarding experience for passengers. By enabling passengers to tap their RFID cards to board, the system ensures fast boarding and secure payment processing, providing a modern, contactless alternative to traditional ticketing.

## Features

- **Contactless Boarding**: Allows passengers to tap their RFID card to access the bus, making the boarding process faster and more convenient.
- **Automatic Validation**: Validates the passengerâ€™s booking and payment status with real-time updates through the backend Firebase database.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with the user, driver, and admin apps to synchronize passenger data, update bookings, and manage routes in real time.
- **Real-Time Data Sync**: Instantly updates backend records when passengers board using their RFID cards, enabling accurate tracking and reporting.

## Technology and Infrastructure

- **Hardware**: Standard RFID card reader compatible with NFC and RFID-enabled smart cards.
- **Backend**: Connected to Firebase Realtime Database to validate passenger bookings and manage boarding events.
- **Security Protocols**: Encryption protocols ensure that passenger information and transaction data remain private and secure.

## How It Works

1. **Passenger Registration**: Passengers register their RFID cards in the app or at registration points, linking them to their accounts.
2. **Booking Confirmation**: When a passenger books a reservation, it is recorded in the Firebase database and linked to their RFID card.
3. **Boarding Process**: The passenger taps their RFID card on the reader, which checks the backend for booking validation.
4. **Driver & Admin Notifications**: Successful boarding updates are sent to both the driver and admin panels, allowing real-time monitoring of passenger counts.

## Advantages

- **Quick and Efficient Boarding**: Reduces time spent on manual ticket validation and improves boarding efficiency.
- **Enhanced Passenger Experience**: Provides a seamless and modern boarding experience with minimal wait times.
- **Improved Security**: Eliminates cash transactions on board and reduces fraud risks by ensuring all boardings are authorized.
- **Accurate Data Collection**: Facilitates data-driven decision-making by collecting and syncing real-time passenger data.

## Setup Instructions

> **Note**: Ensure compatibility between the RFID reader and NFC/RFID card types being used in the system.

1. **Connect RFID Reader**: Set up the RFID reader at designated entry points for buses or portable devices as needed.
2. **Database Configuration**: Ensure the Firebase Realtime Database is set up for secure communication between the reader and the backend.
3. **Testing**: Confirm that the reader accurately detects and processes boarding events, syncing with the Firebase backend for each valid transaction.
